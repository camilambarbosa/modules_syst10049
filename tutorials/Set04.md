#### A. Create your own version of the following examples from  [HTML lists](https://padlet.com/ellen_bajcar/ofcrakue7fyy) in directory `C:\public_html\syst10049\lists`:
- `index.html` (contains header with H1 "HTML Lists", common navigation, and common footer - nothing in main, no aside)
- `content\list07.html` (contains header with H1 "HTML Lists", common navigation, and common footer - H3 "List 7" and list 7 solution in main, no aside)
- `content\list08.html` (contains header with H1 "HTML Lists", common navigation, and common footer - H3 "List 8" and list 8 solution in main, no aside)
- `content\list09.html` (contains header with H1 "HTML Lists", common navigation, and common footer - H3 "List 9" and list 9 solution in main, no aside)
- `content\list10.html` (contains header with H1 "HTML Lists", common navigation, and common footer - H3 "List 10" and list 10 solution in main, no aside)
- `content\list11.html` (contains header with H1 "HTML Lists", common navigation, and common footer - H3 "List 11" and list 11 solution in main, no aside)
- `content\list12.html` (contains header with H1 "HTML Lists", common navigation, and common footer - H3 "List 12" and list 12 solution in main, no aside)
- `content\list13.html` (contains header with H1 "HTML Lists", common navigation, and common footer - H3 "List 13" and list 13 solution main, no aside)

	 - [ ] start with minimal HTML5 document
	 - [ ] add standard content organization (as demonstrated in class)
	 - [ ] try to mark it up without looking at the html code
	 - [ ] if you have to look, document (in comments) why, dig deeper, make notes.
* test the page by running it with Chrome (check that the title and the content display as expected).
* validate your code at [W3C Validation Markup Service](https://validator.w3.org) (remove all warnings and errors);
* re-test and document your observations in the prologue's description;
* explore deeper by looking up references for any unfamiliar elements and attributes; 
* pay close attention to values that can be assigned to the attributes; 
* are the attributes global or element-specific?
* complete and test navigation; make sure you test all possible links (from each file to every other file, and back)
* add to your written code, as comments, all corrections and observations.
* publish on dev.fast server webspace (same location as your local mirror).

#### B. Create your own version of the following examples from  [HTML Tables](https://padlet.com/ellen_bajcar/bbpo9guhtfxs) in directory `C:\public_html\syst10049\tables`:
- `index.html` (contains header with H1 "HTML Tables", navigation, and common footer, no aside)
- in the main element, create tables, with corresponding H3 headings: Table 03, Table 04, Table 05, Table 06, Table 07, and Table 09, and Table 12.
- mark each each heading as a bookmark and use them to create the navigation.
- follow the same process as in Exercise A.
